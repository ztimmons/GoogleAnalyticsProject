# GoogleAnalyticsProject
My Final Project

The goal of this project was to classify revenue from the Google Merchandise Store using information from Google Analytics. 
The data from the project was derived from <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction'>
the Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction</a> page. Unlike the competition goals however, the goal here is a Binary Classification, 
attempting to determine whether or not a customer has spent money on the site. 
I have created a two-tiered classification system which represents two different advertising budgets with which you can target your 
most likely customers.
